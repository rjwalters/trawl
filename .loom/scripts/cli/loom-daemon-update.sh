# loom-daemon-update.sh - Self-update the RAW loom-daemon process (Issue #3968)
#
# Closes the "self-update gap" observed during the 2026-07-25/26 canary
# rollout: the daemon's self-repair loop filed AND fixed 16 of its own
# defects, but every merged fix only took effect after an operator manually
# rebuilt the Rust binary, reprovisioned it, and restarted the process. This
# script is the single operator command that does all three, in order,
# preserving the FLAGS-OFF/opt-in autonomy contract across the restart.
#
# Staleness detection strategy (primary, zero-network): compare the git
# commit BAKED INTO the currently-resolved `loom-daemon` binary (embedded at
# build time via build.rs -> LOOM_DAEMON_GIT_COMMIT, surfaced in
# `loom-daemon --version`) against the LOCAL source tree's current HEAD short
# commit. This answers the directly actionable question — "would rebuilding
# right now produce a different binary?" — without touching the network.
#
# Checkout freshness (default, ff-first — #4330): the whole point of running
# this script is to get the daemon onto the LATEST code, so before resolving
# the local HEAD used for the staleness comparison above, this script attempts
# a bounded, best-effort `git fetch` of origin/<default-branch> and, if local
# HEAD is behind, a `git merge --ff-only`. On success the rebuild below builds
# the freshly-synced HEAD. If the ff-merge cannot apply (diverged local
# commits, or a dirty tracked file conflicts with the incoming change) the
# script ABORTS (exit 1) rather than guessing or hard-resetting — a stale
# rebuild silently missing merged commits (the 2026-07-29 incident this issue
# closes) is worse than a loud abort asking the operator to resolve it by
# hand. A fetch failure/timeout (offline, network degraded) is NOT treated as
# "behind" — the script warns and proceeds with local HEAD as-is, so this
# check never makes the script hard-network-dependent. `--allow-stale`
# restores the pre-#4330 build-what's-here behavior (skips the fetch+merge
# entirely) for deliberate use (bisecting, testing a local patch) — see below.
#
# It:
#   - detects whether the resolved binary is stale vs. the local source tree,
#   - rebuilds (`cargo build --release`) in loom-daemon/ when stale (or
#     --force),
#   - provisions the fresh binary to wherever the resolved binary lives
#     (LOOM_DAEMON_BIN override, else the machine-level ~/.local/bin install
#     via scripts/install/provision-daemon.sh, matching #3922's convention),
#   - reads the flags loom-daemon-start.sh persisted at the last invocation
#     (.loom/.daemon.flags, #3968) and restarts with EXACTLY those flags —
#     never more, never fewer. A daemon that was NOT running is left
#     stopped (this script never widens FLAGS-OFF by starting autonomy that
#     wasn't already running).
#
# Stale-entry-point advisory (#4079 hardening, epic #4081 Phase 4 / #4557):
# on every path — including --check, --dry-run, and an up-to-date no-op — this
# script scans PATH for `loom-*` executables that do NOT resolve to the
# loom-daemon binary it just resolved, and WARNS about each one. This is the
# #4079 failure mode: a long-gone `pip install -e loom-tools` left frozen
# console scripts in ~/.local/bin that kept shadowing the Rust binary's own
# entry points, so agents ran ancient logic while `--version` looked fresh.
# Since #4557 deleted that Python package, nothing regenerates such scripts
# ever again. The warning ALSO fires when PATH holds more than one
# `loom-daemon` (the first shadows the rest). It is advisory only: nothing is
# deleted, PATH is untouched, and the exit code is unaffected. The
# auto-generated `loom-clean`/`loom-recover-orphans`/`loom-claim` shims
# (#4272/#4275) pointing at the resolved binary are never flagged. (`loom-search`
# was allowlisted here as a legitimate non-daemon Python console script from
# #4557 through #4969 — #4970 retired that package too, so a `loom-search` on
# PATH is now exactly the #4079 failure shape and IS flagged, like any other
# stale entry point.) Suppress with LOOM_SKIP_STALE_ENTRY_POINT_CHECK=1.
#
# Launchd-managed daemons (#4042): on Darwin the daemon is commonly launchd-
# managed (default since #3972/#4054), in which case NEITHER .loom/.daemon.pid
# nor .loom/.daemon.flags reliably reflects "is it running" — the pid file goes
# stale after any KeepAlive:SuccessfulExit relaunch, and a hand-bootstrapped
# daemon has no state files at all. This script therefore checks the launchd job
# state (`launchctl print <domain>/<label>`, where <domain> is
# resolve_launchd_domain()'s gui/<uid> ↦ user/<uid> pick — #4130 — mirroring
# loom-daemon-stop.sh) AHEAD of the pid-file tier when resolving whether/how the
# daemon is running.
# When launchd-managed, it restarts via the `loom-daemon restart` primitive
# (#4077 — sends Request::RestartDaemon over the IPC socket; the supervised
# daemon exits 0 and launchd relaunches it onto the fresh binary with the
# plist's persisted ProgramArguments/EnvironmentVariables). .daemon.flags is NOT
# consulted in this mode (the plist's EnvironmentVariables IS the durable flag
# source), and no "restarting FLAGS-OFF" warning fires. If the running (old)
# binary predates #4077 and refuses the request, this script REFUSES LOUDLY
# (exit 6) and prints how to re-render the plist + relaunch under supervision
# (loom-daemon-update.sh --relaunch), rather than reporting a half-update — the
# exact #4011 silent-autonomy-loss class this closes. The old advice to bootstrap
# the EXISTING plist was itself a bug (#4118): it relaunched under the STALE plist
# (no KeepAlive:SuccessfulExit, no LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR), so every subsequent
# roll hit the same exit 6 forever, and its bootout killed in-flight sweeps
# (sweep children are direct children of the launchd job). --relaunch re-renders
# via loom-daemon-start.sh (installing the supervised keys) while preserving the
# live plist's LOOM_* autonomy env, and SIGTERMs the daemon so sweep children
# reparent instead of being torn down with the job.
#
# systemd --user-managed daemons (Linux, #4260 sub-issue C): the exact same
# ownership-tiering + supervised-restart contract, ported to the systemd --user
# service loom-daemon-start.sh installs (#4268). A `systemd --user` unit's pid
# also goes stale on every `Restart=on-success` relaunch, so it is checked at the
# SAME tier as launchd, ahead of the pid-file tier. The restart itself is driven
# by the identical `loom-daemon restart` IPC primitive (recognized daemon-side by
# `detect_supervisor()` since #4267/PR #4298 when `LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd`
# is present — baked into the rendered unit by loom-daemon-start.sh); a clean
# exit 0 lets systemd's `Restart=on-success` relaunch onto the fresh binary.
# That ack is verified, not trusted (#4950, mirroring #4232's launchd
# verification): the script polls for a NEW, live MainPID within a bounded
# window before reporting success, and — if the unit instead lands in `failed`
# (e.g. a stop-timeout escalation, which `Restart=on-success` never matches) —
# self-heals via `systemctl --user reset-failed <unit> && systemctl --user
# start <unit>` before giving up (exit 7). On a
# refused restart (a pre-#4267 binary with no RestartDaemon handler, or a dead
# socket), the script refuses loudly (exit 6) exactly like launchd, and
# --relaunch (or LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RELAUNCH=1) re-renders the unit and forces
# the relaunch: it harvests the live unit's `Environment=` LOOM_*/token lines,
# SIGTERMs the running daemon (so sweep children reparent instead of being torn
# down), then re-invokes loom-daemon-start.sh — which re-renders the unit
# (installing `LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd`), reloads, and `enable --now`s it
# onto a now-inactive unit, i.e. a genuine restart. `LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD=0`
# disables ALL systemd interaction symmetrically with loom-daemon-start.sh
# --no-systemd / loom-daemon-stop.sh, so a --no-systemd install is never probed
# via systemctl and follows the PID-file/nohup restart path instead. Darwin
# behavior is entirely unaffected — this tier is inert unless
# `is_linux_systemd()` (lib/systemd-user.sh) resolves true.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh              Detect, rebuild if stale, provision, restart (preserving flags)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --check       Detect only; exit 0 (up to date) or 3 (update available); no writes
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --dry-run     Print the plan without building/provisioning/restarting
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --force       Rebuild + provision + restart even if already up to date
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --no-restart  Rebuild + provision only; leave the running daemon untouched
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --relaunch    Launchd/systemd only: after a refused restart, re-render the plist/unit and relaunch under supervision (SIGTERMs the daemon so sweep children reparent; preserves the live LOOM_* env)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --allow-stale Skip the default ff-first sync with origin/<default-branch> and build the current (possibly stale) checkout as-is (#4330) — for deliberate use: bisecting, testing a local patch
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --auto-resolve-safe-abort  When the ff-only sync would otherwise hard-abort (#4330), auto-perform the fix IF the blocking state classifies as safe (#4951): content-identical diverged commits with an otherwise-CLEAN working tree (`git reset --hard origin/<default-branch>`), or dirty tracked files that are ALL Loom-managed installed copies (`git checkout --` them + re-run resync-installed.sh). Any other cause (genuine content divergence, any unmanaged dirty file, or a dirty tracked file co-existing with the content-identical divergence) still hard-aborts unchanged — this flag never widens what's classified as safe, only whether the safe cases are printed (default) or performed
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-update.sh --help
#
# Environment:
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN       Path to the loom-daemon binary (else auto-detected,
#                          same resolution as loom-daemon-start.sh). When set,
#                          the fresh binary is provisioned directly to this
#                          exact path instead of the machine-level default.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR   Machine-level install dir (default ~/.local/bin),
#                          forwarded to provision-daemon.sh.
#   LOOM_SKIP_STALE_ENTRY_POINT_CHECK  1/true/yes suppresses the advisory
#                          stale-`loom-*`-entry-point warning described below.
#   LOOM_SKIP_IDLE_SHUTDOWN_NOTICE  1/true/yes suppresses the advisory
#                          post-update idle-shutdown cron-guard notice (#4697):
#                          "this host will power itself off after N idle
#                          minutes" when a `fleet add-worker
#                          --idle-shutdown-minutes` guard is installed. Silent
#                          (no notice at all) when no such guard exists.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_LAUNCHD    macOS only: 0/false/no disables ALL launchd interaction
#                          (ownership detection + launchd restart), symmetric with
#                          loom-daemon-start.sh / loom-daemon-stop.sh. A daemon
#                          started with --no-launchd / LOOM_DAEMON_LAUNCHD=0 gets
#                          an update that never reads the machine-global launchd
#                          domain and follows the PID-file/nohup restart path.
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL     macOS only: the LaunchAgent label to inspect/restart
#                          (default com.rjwalters.loom-daemon).
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_DOMAIN    macOS only: pin the launchd domain (gui/<uid> or
#                          user/<uid>); else auto-resolved gui→user (#4130),
#                          matching loom-daemon-start.sh / -stop.sh.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD    Linux only: 0/false/no disables ALL systemd interaction
#                          (ownership detection + systemd restart), symmetric with
#                          loom-daemon-start.sh --no-systemd / loom-daemon-stop.sh
#                          (#4268). A daemon started with --no-systemd /
#                          LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD=0 gets an update that never invokes
#                          systemctl and follows the PID-file/nohup restart path.
#   LOOM_SYSTEMD_UNIT      Linux only: the systemd --user unit to inspect/restart
#                          (default loom-daemon.service); must match the start's.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RELAUNCH  Launchd/systemd only: 1/true/yes is equivalent to
#                          passing --relaunch (opt in to the re-render + relaunch
#                          on a refused restart).
#   LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT  Machine mode (Epic #3835 Phase 3b, #4229): set by the
#                          `scripts/loom` dispatcher to the resolved
#                          ~/.local/share/loom checkout before it execs this
#                          script. When set, THIS is the source tree rebuilt
#                          from (overriding the $PWD-based find_repo_root()
#                          below), so `loom update` works from any directory --
#                          a consumer repo, or no repo at all -- instead of
#                          requiring $PWD to already be inside a Loom source
#                          checkout. Direct invocation of this script (no
#                          dispatcher -- the existing dev workflow) never sets
#                          it and is unaffected.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_RESTART_POLL_SECS  macOS/launchd (#4232) AND Linux/systemd
#                          (#4950): seconds to poll for a NEW, live pid after a
#                          `restart` ack before falling back to the
#                          supervisor's self-heal (`launchctl kickstart` on
#                          launchd; `systemctl --user reset-failed && start` on
#                          systemd, and only when the unit is `failed`)
#                          (default 30).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_RESTART_POLL_INTERVAL  Poll interval in seconds between pid
#                          checks (default 1; may be fractional, e.g. 0.5).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_RESTART_KICKSTART_POLL_SECS  macOS/launchd (#4232) AND
#                          Linux/systemd (#4950): seconds to re-poll for a new,
#                          live pid after the self-heal fallback before giving
#                          up (default 15).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  up to date (no-op) OR rebuild+provision+restart succeeded
#   1  usage error / not a source checkout / build or provision failure /
#      the default ff-first sync with origin/<default-branch> could not apply
#      (diverged local commits, a dirty tracked file conflicting with the
#      incoming change, or HEAD is not on <default-branch>) — the script
#      NEVER guesses or hard-resets; resolve manually or pass --allow-stale
#      (#4330). Two of the ff-abort causes classify as safely resolvable
#      (#4951): content-identical diverged commits with an otherwise-CLEAN
#      working tree, or dirty tracked files that are ALL Loom-managed
#      installed copies — by default these still
#      exit 1 but the abort message names the exact safe command; pass
#      --auto-resolve-safe-abort to have the script perform it instead (exit
#      0 on success). Any other cause still hard-aborts unchanged.
#   3  (--check only) update available
#   4  build verification FAILED: the freshly-built binary's embedded commit
#      does not match the source HEAD it was built from. This is a BUILD-SYSTEM
#      defect (a stale baked-in commit — e.g. a build.rs watch-set bug), NOT a
#      compile failure, and retrying cannot fix it; the script refuses to
#      provision the mis-stamped binary (#4053).
#   5  post-provision verification FAILED: the destination binary after a
#      claimed-successful provision is not the expected build (a silent no-op
#      roll — "reports success while shipping nothing"). Distinct from both a
#      compile failure and a provisioning soft-failure (#4053).
#   6  supervised restart FAILED: the daemon is launchd- or systemd-managed but
#      the running (old) binary refused the `loom-daemon restart` IPC request (a
#      pre-#4077/#4267 binary with no RestartDaemon handler, or a dead socket).
#      The fresh binary IS provisioned but the OLD one is still running; the
#      script refuses to report success. Without --relaunch it prints how to
#      re-render the plist/unit and relaunch under supervision, then exits 6;
#      with --relaunch (or LOOM_DAEMON_UPDATE_RELAUNCH=1) it performs that
#      re-render+relaunch itself, propagating loom-daemon-start.sh's exit code
#      (#4042, #4118, #4260 sub-issue C).
#   7  restart ACK'd but never took effect: the running (old) binary accepted
#      the `restart` IPC request (exit 0), but the supervisor never relaunched
#      the job/unit onto a NEW, live pid within the poll window, AND the
#      self-heal fallback also failed to bring it up within its own poll
#      window. On launchd (#4232) the fallback is a plain `launchctl
#      kickstart` (never -k). On systemd (#4950) the fallback is `systemctl
#      --user reset-failed <unit> && systemctl --user start <unit>`, tried ONLY
#      when the unit's ActiveState is confirmed `failed` (systemd never
#      auto-relaunches a `failed` unit even under `Restart=on-success` — a
#      `Result=timeout` stop escalation is the exact incident shape #4950
#      closes). The fresh binary IS provisioned, but the daemon's live status
#      is NOT confirmed — this is the "restart scheduled but the supervisor
#      silently never relaunched" outage class these issues close; the script
#      refuses to report success on the ack alone.
#
# See also: loom-daemon-start.sh (writes .loom/.daemon.flags), loom-daemon-stop.sh
# (SIGTERM -> grace -> SIGKILL; in-flight sweeps survive by design — this
# script relies on that: stopping+restarting the dispatcher never kills
# dispatched work), scripts/install/provision-daemon.sh (machine-level
# provisioning, #3922).

# ---------- stale `loom-*` entry-point check (#4079 hardening, #4557) ---------
#
# THE INCIDENT THIS EXISTS FOR (#4079, the direct motivation for epic #4081):
# a `pip install -e loom-tools` from months earlier had left FROZEN console
# scripts in ~/.local/bin. Those scripts outlived the Python package: they kept
# shadowing the Rust `loom-daemon` binary's own PATH entry points, so operators
# and agents silently ran ancient logic while `loom-daemon --version` reported a
# fresh build. Epic #4081 Phase 4 (#4557) deleted the Python package outright,
# which makes every surviving `loom-*` pip console script pure hazard: nothing
# regenerates or updates them ever again.
#
# This check is a WARNING ONLY. It never deletes anything, never mutates PATH,
# and never changes this script's exit code — an operator's ~/.local/bin is
# theirs, and a false positive must not block an update. Opt out entirely with
# LOOM_SKIP_STALE_ENTRY_POINT_CHECK=1.
#
# A `loom-*` PATH entry is considered LEGITIMATE when it is either:
#   1. `loom-daemon` itself (the native binary), or
#   2. one of the auto-generated PATH shims provision-daemon.sh installs
#      (`loom-clean`, `loom-recover-orphans`, `loom-claim` — #4272/#4275), whose
#      sibling `loom-daemon` resolves to the SAME binary this script resolved.
# Anything else is reported — including a `loom-search` executable, now that
# #4970 retired that package too (see defaults/docs/semantic-search.md): it
# is no longer a legitimate console script, just a frozen entry point from a
# deleted package, exactly the #4079 failure shape.

#: `loom-*` names that are not daemon entry points and must not be flagged.
#: Empty as of #4970 — the one entry this ever held, `loom-search`, is retired.

# hosts on local state that turned out to be safely resolvable by hand).
# These helpers classify which shape applies so the abort message can name
# (or, with --auto-resolve-safe-abort, perform) the exact safe resolution
# instead of a bare "resolve manually".
#
# Safety note: this is the safety-critical branch of loom-daemon-update.sh —
# #4381 was a live incident where an update-script code path silently
# overwrote a real production binary; the same "automation quietly does
# something destructive to real machine state" risk applies here. Do NOT
# widen either check below (e.g. a loose substring/prefix match, or an
# empty-diff check that misses a rename/mode-only change) beyond exactly
# what's specified in #4951 — when genuinely unsure, both helpers must
# return false so the caller falls through to the existing hard abort.

# True (exit 0) iff NO tracked file is dirty in the working tree per

# True (exit 0) iff local <default> and origin/<default> are content-IDENTICAL

# revert nets to no change). Deliberately the plain three-dot merge-base diff
# form with no rename-detection flags, matching the incident's own manual
# check (`git diff origin/main...main`); `git diff --quiet` also treats a
# mode-only change as non-empty, which is the conservative (safe) direction.
#
# Only meaningful when local <default> has commit(s) NOT reachable from
# origin/<default> (a genuine history divergence) — the `--is-ancestor` guard
# below is load-bearing, not an optimization: when local <default> IS an
# ancestor of origin/<default> (the far more common shape: origin simply
# advanced and local added no commits of its own), the three-dot form trivially
# reduces to diffing local HEAD against itself (merge-base == local HEAD),
# which is ALWAYS empty regardless of what origin changed — so without this
# guard, every plain "blocked by a dirty tracked file" ff-abort (managed or
# not) would misclassify as content-identical and risk an incorrect
# `reset --hard` under --auto-resolve-safe-abort. In that ancestor case the ff
# failure is necessarily a dirty/conflicting working-tree file instead, which
# the OTHER classifier below is responsible for.
#
# ALSO requires a CLEAN working tree relative to local HEAD: both checks above
# compare only COMMITTED refs, so on their own they say nothing about
# uncommitted work sitting in the working tree. A host can simultaneously have
# (a) diverged local commits that net to zero content diff vs. origin and (b)
# an entirely unrelated dirty tracked file (an operator's manual scratch edit,
# managed or not) — `git merge --ff-only` fails on the history divergence
# alone, so this branch is reached, and without this guard the caller's
# --auto-resolve-safe-abort `git reset --hard origin/<default>` would silently
# discard that file's uncommitted changes. The resolution this classifier
# vouches for is only safe when there is no uncommitted work for it to
# destroy, so ANY dirty tracked file makes us return false and fall through —
# to the managed-dirty classifier below, and failing that to the existing hard

# that caused the refused restart) — bootstrapping it relaunches WITHOUT
# KeepAlive:SuccessfulExit and WITHOUT LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR, so the next roll
# refuses identically, forever; and its `launchctl bootout` tears down the whole
# job tree, killing in-flight sweeps (they are direct children of the launchd
# job). The correct fix is to RE-RENDER the plist via loom-daemon-start.sh (which
# hardcodes the two supervised keys), preserving the live plist's autonomy/auth
# env, and to stop the old daemon gracefully so sweep children reparent.

# harvest_plist_env is defined in lib/daemon-env-harvest.sh (#4581, sourced
# near the top of this script) — shared with scripts/loom's loom_cmd_restart()
# bare-exec fallback so both call sites apply the identical harvest-and-
